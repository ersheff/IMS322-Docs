# IMS322 Docs

A collection of documents and example code developed for a course I teach - IMS322: Intermediate Interaction Design and Development.

[IMS322 Docs site](https://ersheff.github.io/IMS322-Docs/)

This required course ensures that all students in the degree program, many of whom have little or no prior coding experience, understand the basic syntax and patterns used in many programming languages. The class is structured around multiple web-based creative interaction design projects, each progressively applying JavaScript to add interactivity to their HTML and CSS.

Many existing resources, such as MDN Web Docs, often prove too complex for beginners. The IMS322 Docs site grew out of a need to provide our students with modern, beginner-friendly, bite-sized documentation, along with accompanying example code they can review and practice with outside of class.

Features:

- **CodePen** hosts dozens of original embedded code examples I created for this site, each with a live preview that students can review or fork.
- **MkDocs** generates well-organized documentation that is easy to navigate.

Hosted with **GitHub Pages**.
