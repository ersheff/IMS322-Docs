# Flexbox - XXX

Flexbox is used to create responsive layouts. It is typically best for 1-dimensional rows or columns, though more complex layouts can be achieved by nesting flexboxes inside of each other.

From [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/):

> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; gap: 1ch;">
	<div style="flex: 1; max-width: 350px">
		<img src="../images/01-container.svg" style="width: 100%">
	</div>
	<div style="flex: 1; max-width: 350px">
		<img src="../images/02-items.svg" style="width: 100%">
	</div>
</div>

The CSS Tricks article linked above is an excellent reference for all things flexbox. From that article, there are 7 key properties that can be used to accomplish most layout goals:

- Container properties:
  - `display` - Set to `flex` to define a flex container (create a flexbox).
  - `flex-direction` - Set to `row` (the default) or `column`.
  - `flex-wrap` - By default, flexbox will try to fit everything in one row or column. Set this property to `wrap` to wrap flex items to multiple lines (only works if items have a fixed or minimum size).
  - `justify-content` - Defines the alignment along the main axis.
  - `align-items` - Defines the alignment along the cross axis.
  - `gap` - Controls the space between flex items.
- Item properties:
  - `flex` - Determines how much space an item will inhabit proportionally. For example, a flex item with `flex: 2` will take up twice as much space as a flex item with `flex: 1`.

Demonstrated in the example below:

- Flexbox 1 is a row with 3 items in which the last item (with class `.double-item`) is twice as large as the other two due to the `flex: 2` property.
- Flexbox 2 is a column with 3 items in which the item width is limited to `80ch`. The items are then aligned to the center of the column with `align-items: center`.
- Flexbox 3 is a row with 6 items in which the item width is fixed at `20ch`. The `flex-wrap` property is set to `wrap`. This allows the items to wrap around to another row if there is not enough room to fit them all in the first row.
