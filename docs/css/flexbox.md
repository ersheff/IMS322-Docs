# Flexbox

Flexbox is used to create responsive layouts. It is typically considered ideal for 1-dimensional rows or columns, though more complex layouts can be achieved by nesting flexboxes inside of each other.

From CSS Tricks' ["A Complete Guide to Flexbox"](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/):

> The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

The CSS Tricks article ["A Complete Guide to Flexbox"](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is an excellent reference for all things flexbox. To get started, this selection of seven properties (demonstrated in the example below) can be used to accomplish most layout goals:

**Container properties:**

- `display` - Set this property value to `flex` to create a flexbox container.
- `flex-direction` - Options are `row` (the default) or `column`.
- `flex-wrap` - By default, flexbox will try to fit everything in one row. Set the value of this property to `wrap` to wrap flex items to multiple rows as needed (only works if items have a fixed or minimum size).
- `justify-content` - Defines the alignment along the main axis.
- `align-items` - Defines the alignment along the cross axis.
- `gap` - Controls the space between flex items.

**Item properties:**

- `flex` - Determines how much space an item will inhabit proportionally. For example, a flex item with `flex: 2` will take up twice as much space as a flex item with `flex: 1`.
