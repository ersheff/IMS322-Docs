# Media Queries

Media queries allow you to responsively apply different styling depending on a device's screen resolution. Some of the most common applications for media queries include adjustments to the visibility, size, or orientation (row vs. column) of elements to better fit on mobile displays, though any property can be modified as needed.

Since our main class projects target display widths of `1100px` (default), `800px`, and `480px`, each assignment template has been created with predefined media queries for the two smaller values.

_When testing responsiveness with embedded CodePen examples, you should open the Pen in its own window by clicking **Edit On CodePen** and using your browser's [Device Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode) (Chromium-based) or [Responsive Design Mode](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/) (Firefox)._
