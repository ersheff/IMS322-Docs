# Responsive Web Design Overview

**Responsive web design** (RWD) is an approach that helps ensure web pages render well across a range of screen sizes and resolutions.

Have you ever visited a site on your mobile device and noticed that some elements are too small, or that content disappears off the side of the screen? That's not a great user experience!

Most modern commercial sites are designed to be responsive by experienced web development teams. For example, visit the following pages and try resizing your browser window:

- [EarthQuaker Devices](https://www.earthquakerdevices.com)
- [GameStop](https://www.gamestop.com)
- [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu)

What did you notice about how the layouts changed at different window widths?

There are several aspects to RWD, but we will focus on the following:

1. Flexible grid layouts (using [**Flexbox**](flexbox.md) or [**Grid**](grid.md))
2. Flexible images (discussed in [**Optimizing Images**](../res/optimizing-images.md))
3. [**Mobile-first design**](mobile-first.md) enhanced with [**media queries**](mobile-first.md#media-queries)
