# Variables - XXX

You can declare CSS variables (aka custom properties) at the top of your stylesheet in the `:root` pseudo-element. These can then be referenced throughout the rest of the document by their variable name.

CSS variables help to ensure consistency of custom properties throughout your site (e.g. apply a specific color in multiple places without needing to remember the exact HEX code). They can also make it easier to test variations since you only need to change a property once where it was initially declared - the change will automatically propagate through every instance where the variable was used.
