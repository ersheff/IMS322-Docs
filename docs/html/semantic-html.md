# Semantic HTML

[Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) tags describe the meaning and role of their content and improve accessibility for users of screen readers.

It is not about learning a new set of HTML elements, but rather about a developer’s mindset and approach to choosing the most appropriate tags for the content.

Examples of semantic tags include:

- `<h1>` (contains the top-level page heading)
- `<main>` (identifies the main content area of the page)
- `<nav>` (contains links used to navigate the site)
- `<form>` (contains a collection of inputs for gathering data)

Examples of generic tags:

- `<span>`
- `<div>`
