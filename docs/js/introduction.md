# JavaScript

JavaScript began as the programming language for the web. Since the initial release, its use has expanded to non-browser environments, including servers and desktop applications. In fact, VS Code is built using a framework called [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a popular tool that allows web developers to create desktop applications.

While HTML creates the content and structure of a page, and CSS adds styling and animation, JavaScript provides dynamic behavior. Take a look at the embedded Pen below. While you may not fully understand what the JavaScript is doing at this point, some parts of the code might seem familiar. Try editing the code to change the message that is displayed when you click the button.

To learn more about JavaScript and its uses, read the [What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) article on MDN Web Docs.
