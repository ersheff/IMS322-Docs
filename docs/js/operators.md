# Operators

In previous examples, you have likely encountered a few operators that have fairly obvious purposes:

```js
const y = x + 10;
const z = x - 1;
```

Many other JavaScript operators are similarly self-explanatory, though some useful ones may require additional explanation.

## Arithmetic Operators

The standard arithmetic operators are

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`

Other useful arithmetic operators in JavaScript include:

- Modulo `%` (returns the remainder of dividing two numbers)
- Increment `++` (increases a value by 1)
- Decrement `--` (decreases a value by 1)

```js
let x = 24 % 7; // x is 3
x++; // x is now 4
x--; // x is now 3 again
```

### Order of Precedence

Remember **PEMDAS** from math class?

1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication
4. **D**ivision
5. **A**ddition
6. **S**ubtraction

This same order of operator precedence applies in JavaScript, so be sure to construct your expressions appropriately.

```js
const notAverage = 5 + 10 + 15 / 3; // results in 20, which is NOT the average of 5, 10, and 15
const actuallyAverage = (5 + 10 + 15) / 3; // results in 10, which IS the average of 5, 10, and 15
```

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators execute an arithmetic operation and new value assignment in one step. _This will not work on variables declared with `const` since the original value is being changed._

```js
let x = 7;
x += 3; // x is now 10
```

Other assignment operators include:

- Subtraction assignment `-=`
- Multiplication assignment `*=`
- Division assignment `/=`
- Remainder assignment `%=`

## String Concatenation

When working with strings, `+` is the concatenation operator, joining strings together. String concatenation is especially useful for inserting values into longer messages.

```js
const myName = "Eric";
const welcomeMessage = "Welcome, " + myName + ".";
console.log(welcomeMessage); // logs "Welcome, Eric." to the console
```

_When using the console with embedded CodePen examples, you should open the Pen in its own window by clicking **Edit On CodePen** and then clicking the **Console** button in the CodePen editor._
