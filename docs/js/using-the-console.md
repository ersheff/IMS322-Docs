title: Using the Console
---

The console is part of the developer tools in your browser. Although anyone can open the developer tools, the console is generally not viewed by users. One of its purposes is to display messages for developers. These messages might include errors, but you can also manually log helpful information using the console.log() method.

CodePen has its own simplified console. It can be opened and closed by clicking the Console button when you have a Pen open in the full editor (i.e. by clicking Edit on CodePen). You can use the browser’s console in the developer tools - just be aware that there may be some warnings and error messages created by other parts of the site you are on.

Try changing the code in the JavaScript below - remember, you’ll need to have either the CodePen or browser console open to see the logged messages.
