# Using the Console

The console is part of the [Developer Tools](../ref/browser-review.md#developer-tools) in your browser. While anyone can open the developer tools, the console is typically not viewed by users. Take a moment to ensure you can find your browser's console.

One of the console's main purposes is to display messages for developers. These messages can include automatically generated warnings and errors, but you can also manually log information using the `console.log()` method.

CodePen has its own simplified console. You will still see console output from your Pen in the the browserâ€™s developer tools, but be aware that there will likely be additional messages not generated by the JavaScript in your Pen, which could be confusing.

_When using the console with embedded CodePen examples, you should open the Pen in its own window by clicking **Edit On CodePen** and then clicking the **Console** button in the CodePen editor._
