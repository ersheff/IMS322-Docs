# Variables - XXX

A variable is a named container for data. The name of the container is up to you (take a look at naming guidelines in the [IMS322 Style Guide](../style-guide)), but ideally it has some meaning that relates to the data being stored. To declare a variable, start with the keyword `let` and assign a starting value with `=`.

```js
let myName = "Eric";
```

The purpose of variables may not be obvious at first, but a crucial part of interaction design and development is storing, gathering, and manipulating data. Variables make this process much more practical and flexible.

Remember, you'll need to open the console in order to see the results of `console.log()`.
