## Optimizing Images

### Image Resolution and Compression

Although internet speeds are much faster than they used to be, it is still important to reduce image file sizes if possible with suitable resolution and compression settings.

For resolution, you should consider how much of the browser window your images will cover (in pixels), and then _double that value_ when cropping or downloading image files. Assuming a maximum `1100px` layout width:

- An image that will span the entire body should have a width around `2200px`.
- An image that will span half the body (e.g. in a 2-column layout) should have a width around `1100px`.
- An image that will span 1/3 the body (e.g. in a 3-column layout) should have a width around `734px`.
- When using images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos), specify the resolution in the URL.
- When using images downloaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), another stock photo site, or your own original image files, resize them using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) or your preferred photo editing application before incorporating them into your project.

There are several different types of image compression suitable for the web. For simplicity, all images used in your projects should be in the "WebP" format.

- When using images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos), simply add `.webp` to the end of the URL.
- When using images downloaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), another stock photo site, or your own original image files, choose "WebP" when compressing your files using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) or your preferred photo editing application before incorporating them into your project.

### Image Containers

It is highly recommended to wrap all `<img>` elements in a parent `<div>` or, if captions are needed, `<figure>` element (with `<figcaption>` tags). This will generally make it easier to attain the desired size, position, and aspect ratio in flexible layouts. Additionally, while it might not suit every need, setting `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` as the default properties for all images will probably work best for most situations.
