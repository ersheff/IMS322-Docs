# Aritifical Intelligence

_Excerpted from the course syllabus_:

I encourage the use of AI tools as _companions_ to help brainstorm, troubleshoot, and proofread. However, it is important that you meet assignment objectives and submit quality work. While I cannot cover every scenario, here are a few suggestions and requirements:

- Write specific and detailed prompts.
- Verify facts, statistics, or procedures independently.
- Start with your own ideas, then use AI to assist with revisions.
- You must provide sources for any AI-generated content. Failure to do so will prompt further investigation and may be considered an act of [academic dishonesty](https://miamioh.edu/policy-library/students/undergraduate/academic-regulations/academic-integrity.html).

      - **For IMS322**: If using GitHub Copilot, export the session as a .json file by opening the Command Palette in VS Code and running "Chat: Export Sessionâ€¦" Save this file in your project folder before submission.
      - **For other courses**: If using ChatGPT, there is an option to share a link to each chat session. Include this link somewhere in your submitted materials.
