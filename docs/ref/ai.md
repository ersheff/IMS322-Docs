# Aritifical Intelligence

_Excerpted from the course syllabus_:

I encourage the use of AI tools as _companions_ to help brainstorm, troubleshoot, and proofread. However, it is important that you meet assignment objectives and submit quality work. While I cannot address every scenario, here are a few suggestions and requirements:

- Write specific and detailed prompts.
- Verify facts, statistics, or procedures independently.
- Start with your own ideas, then use AI to assist with revisions.
- **For IMS322**: You are expected to use the techniques from class examples and demonstrations, even when generating code using GitHub Copilot or other AI tools. Review the specific assignment objectives for more detailed requirements.
