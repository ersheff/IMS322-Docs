# Browser Review

As discussed during [Setup](../setup), browsers are built on different engines. Most things will work more or less the same in all browsers, but you may occasionally discover situations where an element or style renders differently or a feature that you want to use has not yet been implemented.

The content that we cover in this class has deliberately been selected to have support across all modern browsers. However, some unexpected quirks or surprises may still arise. If you are troubleshooting a problem in Chrome and are not able to find the cause in your code, it is a good idea to simply try opening your project in Firefox (or vice versa). You may find that it works as expected in a different browser, in which case you can turn your attention to addressing that specific cross-browser compatability issue.

## Developer Tools

All modern browsers have built-in Developer Tools to aid development. There are many features in the Developer Tools that we will not cover this semester, but it is very important that you are familiar with the following concepts:

- Find the Developer Tools.
- View and edit the HTML content of an open page.
- View and edit the CSS of an open page.
- Open a page in Device Mode or Responsive Design Mode, which provides a convenient way to test your site at different screen sizes and orientations.

The links below cover all of these topics in Chrome and Firefox. If you are using a different Chromium-based browser, like Edge or Brave, the Chrome documentation is likely similar enough to get you started, but you may still want to search for specific documentation.
