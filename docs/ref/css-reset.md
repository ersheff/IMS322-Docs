title: CSS Reset
---

One of the purposes of a CSS Reset is to start with a clean slate and not have to wrestle with unexpected layout or styling issues due to default browser properties. The basic CSS Reset in the embedded example below is a recommended starting point for your projects in this class. It does the following:

- Removes default `padding`, `margin`, and `border` from all elements.
- Sets the [`box-sizing` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) of all elements to `border-box`, which typically results in more predictable and manageable sizing and spacing.
- Sets the `max-width` property of all `img` elements to `100%`, which encourages a more consistent approach to flexible and responsive images.
- Provides pre-formatted media queries for `800px` and `480px` window widths to use as needed.
