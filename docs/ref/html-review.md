# HTML Review

## Basic Elements

You should be familiar with all of the tags listed below, which have been excerpted from Kevin Powell's ["The Only Tags You Need to Know (for now)."](../assets/the-only-tags-that-you-need-to-know-for-now.pdf)

- Metadata tags: `<html>` `<head>` `<title>` `<link>` `<body>`
- Content tags: `<h1>`...`<h6>` `<p>` `<a>` `<ol>` `<ul>` `<li>` `<span>` `<img>`
- Layout tags: `<header>` `<main>` `<footer>` `<nav>` `<article>` `<section>` `<div>`

## Semantic HTML

[Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) tags describe the contents of the element and improve accessibility for people that use screen readers. Try to use the most appropriate tags whenever possible.

Examples of semantic tags include:

- `<form>` (contains a collection of inputs)
- `<h1>` (contains the top-level page heading)
- `<main>` (identifies the main content area of the page)
- `<nav>` (contains links to navigate the site)

Examples of generic tags:

- `<span>`
- `<div>`

## Attributes

You will likely need use all of these attributes in your projects throughout the semester:

- `alt`: alternate text for an `<img>` tag
- `class`: for use as a selector in CSS
- `href`: url for `<a>` tags
- `id`: for use as a query in JavaScript
- `src`: path to image to be displayed for `<img>` tags
