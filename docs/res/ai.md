# Aritifical Intelligence

_Excerpted from the course syllabus_:

I encourage the use of AI tools as companions for brainstorming, troubleshooting, and proofreading. However, you must still meet learning objectives and submit quality, original work. Unauthorized use of AI is considered an act of academic dishonesty according to [campus policy](https://miamioh.edu/policy-library/students/undergraduate/academic-regulations/academic-integrity.html). While I cannot cover every possible scenario, here are a few suggestions and requirements to guide your use of AI:

- Write specific and detailed prompts to get useful, constructive results.
- Independently verify facts, statistics, or procedures.
- Start with your own ideas, then use AI to assist with revisions.
- Be mindful and maintain your own purpose and voice. Do you really want AI to do your thinking or communication for you? Do you really want AI to rob you of learning and experience?
- **For coding classes**: You are expected to use and be able to explain specific techniques outlined in assignment descriptions.
