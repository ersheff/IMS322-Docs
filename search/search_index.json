For resolution, you should consider how much of the browser window your images will cover (in pixels), and then double that value when cropping or downloading image files. Assuming a maximum 1100px layout width: An image that will span the entire body should have a width around 2200px . An image that will span half the body (e.g. in a 2-column layout) should have a width around 1100px . An image that will span 1/3 the body (e.g. in a 3-column layout) should have a width around 734px . When using images from Lorem Picsum , specify the resolution in the URL. When using images downloaded from Unsplash , another stock photo site, or your own original image files, resize them using Squoosh or your preferred photo editing application before incorporating them into your project. There are several different types of image compression suitable for the web. For simplicity, all images used in your projects should be in the \"WebP\" format.

Image Containers It is highly recommended to wrap all <img> elements in a parent <div> or, if captions are needed, <figure> element (with <figcaption> tags). This will generally make it easier to attain the desired size, position, and aspect ratio in flexible layouts. Additionally, while it might not suit every need, setting max-width: 100% and height: auto as the default properties for all images will probably work best for most situations.

It is recommended that you follow the steps below in the order listed. Install Git . Create a GitHub account (if neeeded). Login to CodePen . Install additional browsers (if needed). Install VS Code and configure with extensions and settings. Review assignment procedures . Git Git is a \"version control system\" that helps track and manage changes in files. While Git itself is very powerful, we will primarily be using it through the Source Control panel in VS Code. Mac Mac users should follow the Homebrew installation option : Install Homebrew . Run the brew install git in Terminal. If prompted, install the \"command line developer tools.\" This will likely take a while... Windows Windows users should use the 64-bit Git for Windows Setup under Standalone Installer . Linux If you're using Linux, you probably don't need help installing Git! Follow the instructions here . GitHub GitHub is a platform for creating, storing, and managing code. It relies on Git to commit and sync changes between files stored locally on your computer (the ones that you'll be editing in VS Code) and online repositories. In this class, we will be using GitHub to manage all major assignments. Create a GitHub account. Register for GitHub Student Benefits (this will give you access to the GitHub Copilot AI assistant). CodePen - XXX CodePen is a popular online code editor focused on creating and sharing snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Pros Can login with GitHub account Can embed No setup Limitations No free file hosting Clutters up the inspector No fullscreen preview No HTML head Sign-in to CodePen using your GitHub account. Browsers - XXX Although there are many different modern web browsers, there are essentially only 3 different browser engines that currently run them all. A browser engine is essentially the software component \"under the hood\" of the application that handles document layout, rendering, and security. WebKit is maintained by Apple and used for the desktop and mobile versions of Safari . Blink is maintained by Google and powers all Chromium-based browsers, which includes Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge , Brave , Opera GX , and others. Gecko is maintained by Mozilla and used for Firefox . VS Code - XXX Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) is the code editor that we will be using for all major assignments in this class. After installing the VS Code application, follow the instructions below to configure the necessary extensions and settings. Extensions We will be using a small collection of VS Code extensions to assist with formatting and development. Search for the following extensions in the Extensions panel to install: GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat (AI code assistant, requires GitHub Student Benefits) JS-Beautify for VS Code (for HTML formatting) Prettier (for CSS and JavaScript formatting) Live Server (for easy browser preview) Live Share (for collaborative coding) Git and GitHub Click the Accounts icon in the lower-left corner and sign-in using your GitHub account. Click on the Terminal menu and choose \"New Terminal.\" In the Terminal panel, run the following 2 commands, inserting your own username and email where indicated (you will not see a confirmation message): git config --global user.name \"your username\" git config --global user.email your@email.com Editor Settings The following VS Code editor settings are primarily Copy-Paste Configuration Alternatively, you can copy-paste settings in the settings.json file: Go to the View menu and choose Command Palette... Use the search field to find and run the \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\" command. Copy-paste the text below into the open settings.json file. Save and close the file.

This will prompt you to accept the assignment on GitHub Classroom. The first time you accept a GitHub Classroom assignment, you will be asked to link your GitHub account to your name. After a few moments, GitHub Classroom will report that you are ready to go and provide a url to a new fork of the repository. To find this repository in the future, it should be visible in Top Repositories when you first land on the GitHub site. You can also find it by visiting the IMS322-Sheffield-F24 organization Make sure that you are working with the repository called \"assignment-username\" as you will also see the original \"Assignment\" repository that was used as the starting template. Open VS Code and make sure that you do not have any folders open - go to the File menu and choose \"Close Folder.\" Open the Source Control panel and click the Clone Repository button. Copy-paste the url from your repository into the text field. You will be prompted for a location on your computer to save this folder. To open this folder in the future, go to the File menu and choose \"Open Folder\u2026\" Committing and Submitting Assignments It is recommended that you Stage, Commit, and Sync often (steps 1 & 2 below) as that will essentially act as a backup for your files. Make sure that your code is formatted using the built-in formatting tools The IMS322 VS Code profile has \"Format on Save\" enabled by default, but you can also right-click in a file and choose \"Format Document.\" You should see a blue indicator on the Source Control icon. Open the Source Control panel and do the following: Stage all changes by clicking the + next to Changes. Enter a commit message and click the Commit button (use \"finished\" for your final commit). The Commit button should change to a Sync Changes button. Click this to finish syncing the latest changes to your GitHub Repository. Return to your assignment repository on GitHub. Go to Settings and navigate to the Pages section. Under Branch, choose \"main\" and click Save. After a few moments, if you refresh this page, there should now be a URL near the top next to a Visit Site button. If you click this button, you should see your site open in a new window. Copy the URL generated by GitHub Pages, paste it in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas Assignment, and click Submit Assignment. Accepting Assignments Depending on the assignment instructions, do one of the following: Create a new empty Pen by clicking on \"Pen\" in the left sidebar or choosing \"New Pen\" from the menu under your user icon, or... Fork the example Pen (if provided) by clicking the Fork button in the lower-right corner of the editor window. You may need to click Edit on CodePen first if you are looking at an embedded example from the documentation. Change the Pen name to the name provided in the Canvas assignment and click Save. If you need to find this Pen again later, it will be in Your Work. Submitting Assignments Click the Save button in the upper-right corner of the CodePen window. Click Share in the bottom-right corner and select Copy Link. Paste the copied link in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas Assignment and click Submit Assignment. Feedback Feedback will be provided in comments on Canvas.

The IMS322 Style Guide has been assembled from excerpts from reputable sources and observations of best practices. Although it includes many widely adopted conventions, it is by no means intended to be the \"best\" or \"correct\" approach \u2014 after taking this class, you might consider other coding styles based on personal or professional preference. This guide is divided into 2 sections: Expectations : These are the \"specifications\" for all content produced in IMS322 - how to organize files, which file types and formats to use, layout requirements, etc. The conditions in this section will be referenced while reviewing submissions and have a direct impact on your grade. Formatting : These are the guidelines for how your code should look in terms of spacing and indentation. While you should review this information, for the most part, formatting is done automatically in CodePen and VS Code. Expectations General Default filenames index.html style.css script.js Separation of concerns Do not enter any CSS in <style> tags or JavaScript in <script> tags in your HTML file. Reference files as needed in the <head> and write all CSS in the style.css file and JavaScript in the script.js file. Fonts Choose only from the following web safe fonts or a selection from Google Fonts : Arial (sans-serif) Verdana (sans-serif) Tahoma (sans-serif) Trebuchet MS (sans-serif) Times New Roman (serif) Georgia (serif) Courier New (monospace) Brush Script MT (cursive) The web safe fonts listed above should already be installed on your computer, but you may need to download and install fonts from Google Fonts to use in your wireframing application. Always include fallback fonts in your CSS. Image names, compression, and organization Rename long or cryptic image files whenever necessary. For example, dog.webp is much easier to type and identify than neom-9E9NsEiUGxg-unsplash.webp . All images used in your projects should be in the \"WebP\" format. When working with multiple image files, put them all in an \"images\" folder to help keep the file browser organized. Keep in mind, this means that the src attribute of your <img> elements will needs to include the folder as part of the file name e.g. images/dog.webp . Naming conventions Write concise, searchable, and meaningful names. Only use common, easy-to-remember abbreviations if a name becomes excessively long. Class and ID attributes should always be written using the the \"kebab-case\" convention in which lowercase words are separated by hyphens. <p class=\"kebab-case\" id=\"kebab-case\">Blah blah blah.</p> Variables and functions should be written using the \"camelCase\" convention in which each word (except the first) starts with a capital letter (without spaces or hyphens). const favoriteFruit = \"apple\"; CSS * { box-sizing: border-box; } body { max-width: 1100px; margin: auto; } p { max-width: 80ch; } img { width: 100%; } @media (max-width: 800px) { } @media (max-width: 480px) { } Media queries and display size targets Your project layouts will need to work at the following window widths (based on MDN Web Docs recommendations ): 480px (mobile) 800px (tablet, narrow laptop/desktop windows) 1100px (wide laptop/desktop windows) Content in the <body> should not exceed the 1100px maximum width, though background color extending outside that area is acceptable. Media queries for 480px and 800px widths will be pre-configured for you in every project's style.css file to use as needed. Center your content area All content should be constrained to one main column centered within the browser window. This can be accomplished by styling the <body> as a flexbox column or styling the primary content areas like <header> and <main> as flexbox columns. This: Not this: Do not use margin The margin property affects content outside the element on which it is applied, which can cause problems in component-based layouts . Use padding , flexbox justify-content and/or gap , or padding elements to add space or adjust alignment in your layouts. Use relative units by default Recommended relative units: % - Percentage relative to the parent element. ch - The width of the number \"0\" of the element's font. rem - Relative to the default browser font size. In some cases, you may still find that the absolute unit px is the best fit. Some examples: If you want to ensure that a small image in a flexible container never stretches beyond its original resolution, set a max-width property in px . If you want to have specific control over the roundness of box corners, set border-radius in px . You can read more about all the valid absolute and relative units in this MDN Web Docs reference . Only use HEX or RGB color syntax This will help ensure consistency with your wireframe application colors. Example HEX code: #E9967A Example RGB code: rgb(233, 150, 122) There are multiple color helpers on the Utilities page. Do not style with ID selectors Use element and class selectors and CSS nesting to avoid using ID selectors in CSS. This: h2 { color: #0000ff; } .warning { color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; button { background-color: #ff9999; } } Not this: #warning { color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold; } JavaScript Loading JavaScript files Always put your <script> tags in the <head> element with the added defer keyword (not required when working in CodePen). <head> <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" /> <script src=\"script.js\" defer></script> <title>IMS322</title> </head> Declare variables with let or const , not var Use the keywords let (for values that will change) and const (for values that will not change) when declaring variables.

It is typically best for 1-dimensional rows or columns, though more complex layouts can be achieved by nesting flexboxes inside of each other. From CSS Tricks : The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items\u2019 width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. The CSS Tricks article linked above is an excellent reference for all things flexbox. From that article, there are 7 key properties that can be used to accomplish most layout goals: Container properties: display - Set to flex to define a flex container (create a flexbox). flex-direction - Set to row (the default) or column . flex-wrap - By default, flexbox will try to fit everything in one row or column. Set this property to wrap to wrap flex items to multiple lines (only works if items have a fixed or minimum size). justify-content - Defines the alignment along the main axis. align-items - Defines the alignment along the cross axis. gap - Controls the space between flex items. Item properties: flex - Determines how much space an item will inhabit proportionally. For example, a flex item with flex: 2 will take up twice as much space as a flex item with flex: 1 . Demonstrated in the example below: Flexbox 1 is a row with 3 items in which the last item (with class .double-item ) is twice as large as the other two due to the flex: 2 property. Flexbox 2 is a column with 3 items in which the item width is limited to 80ch . The items are then aligned to the center of the column with align-items: center . Flexbox 3 is a row with 6 items in which the item width is fixed at 20ch . The flex-wrap property is set to wrap .

If your goal is to change the appearance of a page element (as opposed to the content), one simple way to do so is by toggling a class on or off. Let's start by creating a button that toggles the color of some text between black (the default) and red. Since we will need to reference both the interactive element <button> AND the changing element <p> , they will both need unique id attributes. <button id=\"color-toggle-btn\">Click Me</button> <p id=\"changing-text\">Hello, world.</p> In CSS, create a class that describes the style changes that should occur on the element <p> when the button is clicked. .red-text { color: red; } In JavaScript, we have 2 new concepts: When writing the function, start by creating variables that reference the element(s) that will change when the function runs. In this case, we will be changing the color of the text in the <p> element. We will use the new method classList.toggle() to add/remove the .red-text class. let colorToggleBtn = document.querySelector(\"#color-toggle-btn\"); colorToggleBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", colorToggle); function colorToggle() { let changingText = document.querySelector(\"#changing-text\"); changingText.classList.toggle(\"red-text\"); } See the Pen Class Toggle 1 (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen . Active/Inactive States One useful application of classList.toggle() is to think of elements having \"active\" and \"inactive\" states. There is nothing new to the code in this approach - rather, it's just a way for you as the developer to mentally model the interaction states. Let's start by created a text drawer that opens and closes when a button is clicked. This type of interaction may be used to show and hide text that will not be visible all the time. In CSS, define a default or \"active\" state for the element. Here, background-color is applied for illustrative purposes (it will make it easier to see the changes). A transition is applied so that the change will occur gradually rather than immediately. Finally, the overflow: hidden property prevents text from spilling out of the drawer when closed. .open-drawer { background-color: lightblue; max-height: 1.2rem; transition: 0.5s; overflow: hidden; } To close the drawer, all we have to do is set its max-height to 0. .closed-drawer { max-height: 0; } Why are we using max-height instead of height? Usually, you would not need to specify a height value for a <p> element as it would be set automatically by the browser. However, in order to have a transition, the element needs a value to transition to/from - auto will not work for this. The reason that we are using max-height instead of height is because then we don't need to be too precise - 1.2rem as an approximation is sufficient for displaying all of the text content without creating extra empty space.

Operator Description Strict equal === Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. Not equal != Returns true if the operands are not equal. Greater than > Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Greater than or equal >= Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Being aware of these types is important when developing your code as they determine what you can do with that data. If you were prompted to \"add 40 and 2 in your head,\" you could easily do so because 40 and 2 are both of the type \"number.\" However, a request to \"add 40 and elephant\" does not have an obvious response. Outside of creative nonsense answers - \"uhh... fortyphant?\" - it doesn't make any sense. In JavaScript, if you try to manipulate data in a way that is expected given the types (e.g. add two numbers together), you should get a logical response. If you try to manipulate data in ways that are not expected given the types (e.g. add numbers to words), then you will either receive an unexpected answer or an error. While you need to be aware of data types, you don't have to specify type when declaring variables. JavaScript is a \"dynamically typed\" language, which means that types are automatically assigned when code is run based on the how the value was assigned. There are 8 different data types in JavaScript: Number BigInt String Boolean Null Undefined Symbol Object For this class, you will be working directly with the Number, String, Boolean, and Object types. You should also know about the Null and Undefined types since they may appear when troubleshooting. The BigInt and Symbol types are a bit more esoteric and will likely not be relevant to your work in this class, though they are included below for comprehensiveness. Number let myNumber = 42; BigInt As the name suggests, the BigInt type is used to store very large integer values. Accurate up to 15 digits.

There are several triggers for events , some that occur automatically (e.g. the load event fires when the page has finished loading), and others that occur in response to an interaction from the user (e.g. the click event fires when the user clicks on a page element). In this class, we will primarily be focussed on the latter category. In order to make something happen in response to an event, we need to attach an event listener to the interactive element in JavaScript. Adding an Event Listener As with many coding scenarios, there are multiple ways to approach browser-based interaction development. For consistency and simplicity, the recommended procedure for this class is as follows: Declare a variable to reference the interactive element. Write a function that defines what should happen when the interaction occurs. Add an event listener that calls the function. Step 1: Declare a variable to reference the interactive element In addition to the basic data types that we have already covered (number, string, boolean), a variable can also be assigned to an HTML element . let myButton = document.querySelector(\"#my-button\"); Notice that the argument of this method begins with # , which is the CSS selector for ids - this implies that the element we are trying to reference should have a matching id attribute. <button id=\"my-button\">Click Me</button> Also notice that the naming convention for the id in HTML (and where it is used in querySelector ) is kebab-case , while the variable name in JavaScript is camelCase . I recommend using the same words for both the id and the variable name, but styled appropriately (kebab-case or camelCase, based on location in code). Step 2: Write a function that defines what should happen when the interaction occurs In this simple example, we will log the message \"Button was clicked!\"\" to the console. function wasClicked() { console.log(\"Button was clicked!\"); } Step 3: Add an event listener that calls the function The event listener should be added to the element that fires the desired event - in this case, the element that the user interacts with , which is a button. As previously mentioned, there are many different kinds of events that can be listened for - we will specifically be listening for the click event. myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", wasClicked); Notice that this statement begins with the variable name that we created in step 1. The addEventListener() method is given 2 arguments: the event type to listen for ( \"click\" ), followed by the name of the function we created in step 2 ( wasClicked ).

It is built using 3 expressions: for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) { // code block to be executed } Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block. Typically, this is used to initialize a counter variable at 0. Conventionally, this variable is named i . Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block. Essentially, it determines the number of times the code block will be executed. Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed. This is typically written as i++ to increment the counter variable. See the Pen For Loops (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen . The counter variable can be used in arithmetic expressions like any other number. See the Pen For Loops Accumulator (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen . The counter variable can be also be used as an index number to lookup each value in an array. See the Pen For Loops and Arrays (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen . For Of Loops Arrays are an example of something that is iterable . This means that we can iterate over all of the values of an array using a for...of loop. for (const variable of iterable) { // do something multiple time, once for each value in the sequence } In the example presented above, the placeholder iterable would be replaced by the source of the sequence e.g. the variable name of your array. The placeholder variable becomes a temporary variable within the loop that receives a new value from the sequence on each iteration. This can be a little tricky to picture mentally, so let's walk though this example: const myArray = [12, 34, 56, 78]; for (const m of myArray) { console.log(m); } In this case, the source of the sequence is the variable myArray . The for of loop will run 4 times because there are 4 values in the myArray sequence. Each time the loop runs, m will represent the value of each successive value in the array, starting at 12 , then 34 , then 56 , etc. Why did we call the temporary variable m ? Any name is valid, though it is common to see the first letter of the array name used as the temporary variable. Or, in the case of an array with a plural variable name, the singular could be used as the name for the temporary variable. const months = [ \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\" ]; for (const month of months) { console.log(month); } See the Pen For Of Loops (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen .","title":"For Loops"},{"location":"js/for-loops/#for-of-loops","text":"Arrays are an example of something that is iterable .

This can be a little tricky to picture mentally, so let's walk though this example: const myArray = [12, 34, 56, 78]; for (const m of myArray) { console.log(m); } In this case, the source of the sequence is the variable myArray . The for of loop will run 4 times because there are 4 values in the myArray sequence. Each time the loop runs, m will represent the value of each successive value in the array, starting at 12 , then 34 , then 56 , etc. Why did we call the temporary variable m ? Any name is valid, though it is common to see the first letter of the array name used as the temporary variable. Or, in the case of an array with a plural variable name, the singular could be used as the name for the temporary variable. const months = [ \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\" ]; for (const month of months) { console.log(month); } See the Pen For Of Loops (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen .","title":"For Of Loops"},{"location":"js/manipulating-style-properties/","text":"In general, it is recommended to change styling with classList.toggle() or classList.add() and classList.remove() when possible, especially if alternating between 2 states.

They present only one choice: to click or not to click, no other information or decision-making required. There are many HTML input types that vary in their complexity and intended application. Whenever possible, the type of input presented to the user should be the best fit for the information being collected. For example, a generic text input field does not provide a built-in way to provide a list of predetermined choices, while a dropdown menu or group of radio buttons is impractical for a very large number of options. This page provides an overview of some commonly used input types. A full reference for all valid input types can be found here . Selection Controls A selection control allows the user to choose from a group of predetermined choices. The type of selection control presented in the example below, radio buttons, are typically best for multiple-choice style questions in which only one choice can be selected at a time. Some important things to note about radio buttons: The name attribute given to the radio buttons is what groups them together so that only one can be selected at a time. Each radio button is paired with a <label> element to provide text instructions or descriptions. The for attribute of each <label> should be the same as the id of the corresponding radio button. The value attribute is should be gathered in JavaScript. It does not need to be the same as the <label> text. Since there are multiple radio buttons in a set, it can be a tricky to find the value of a checked radio button in JavaScript, especially when used with a single submit button. The recommendation is to use document.querySelector(\"input[type='radio']:checked\") . See the Pen Selection Controls (IMS322 Docs) by Eric Sheffield ( @ersheff ) on CodePen . List Controls List controls allow users to select from a small set of text strings, each representing a command, object, or attribute.

Some important things to note about <select> dropdown menus: Like radio buttons, the value attribute is what will typically be gathered in your JavaScript.

Arithmetic Operators The standard arithmetic operators are + addition - subtraction * multiplication / division The following table lists some of the other useful arithmetic operators in JavaScript: Operator Description Example % remainder Returns the remainder of dividing the two operands. 24 % 7 returns 3, because 24 / 7 is equal to 21 with a remainder of 3. ++ increment Adds one to its operand.

Flex-wrap Sizing When wrapping items in a flexbox, one of the challenges is to create items with flexible yet consistent widths, especially when there are fewer items on the bottom row. The approach used in this example (adapted from the GameStop site) uses media queries to set the width of items to progressively smaller % based on window width. There are a couple of accommodations that need to be made when calculating widths this way in a flexbox: The flexbox gap property cannot be used reliably when attempting to divide the row evenly with %, so we've simulated the gap by putting the items in div containers and adding padding to the container. Since this also means that the padding doubles up between items, side padding is added to the flexbox row to compensate.

The approach used in this example (adapted from the GameStop site) uses media queries to set the width of items to progressively smaller % based on window width. There are a couple of accommodations that need to be made when calculating widths this way in a flexbox: The flexbox gap property cannot be used reliably when attempting to divide the row evenly with %, so we've simulated the gap by putting the items in div containers and adding padding to the container. Since this also means that the padding doubles up between items, side padding is added to the flexbox row to compensate.
