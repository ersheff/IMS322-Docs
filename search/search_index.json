To get started, the following set of seven properties (demonstrated in the example below) can be used to accomplish most layout goals:</p> <p>Container properties:</p> <ul> <li><code>display</code> - Set this property value to <code>flex</code> to create a flexbox container.</li> <li><code>flex-direction</code> - Options are <code>row</code> (the default) or <code>column</code>.</li> <li><code>flex-wrap</code> - By default, flexbox tries to fit everything in one row. Set this property to <code>wrap</code> to allow flex items to wrap into multiple rows as needed (this only works if items have a fixed or minimum size).</li> <li><code>justify-content</code> - Defines the alignment along the main axis.</li> <li><code>align-items</code> - Defines the alignment along the cross axis.</li> <li><code>gap</code> - Controls the space between flex items.</li> </ul> <p>Item properties:</p> <ul> <li><code>flex</code> - Determines how much space an item will occupy proportionally.

Part of the graded requirements for projects is that:</p> <p>\"All images must be in <code>jpeg</code> or <code>webp</code> format with a resolution no larger than <code>3840</code> pixels in width or <code>2160</code> pixels in height. Logos, icons, or other vector drawings may be in <code>svg</code> format. Use Squoosh or another image editor to resize or compress images before adding them to your project (set quality level around 80%).\"</p>"},{"location":"res/optimizing-images/#fluid-images","title":"Fluid Images","text":"<p>It is highly recommended to start sizing all <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements using only <code>max-width: 100%</code>. This ensures they responsively fill their closest parent container, regardless of the original resolution of the image file.
